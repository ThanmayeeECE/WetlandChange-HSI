## <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">INTRODUCTION</span>
Wetlands are the unsung heroes of our ecosystemâ€”storing carbon, purifying water, and sheltering rich biodiversity. But across India, many of them are silently disappearing due to pollution, encroachment, and invasive species.

This repository contains a MATLAB-based project focused on analyzing wetland degradation in India using hyperspectral remote sensing techniques. By leveraging high-resolution spectral data, this project aims to detect changes in vegetation health, water quality, and land use that are not easily visible using traditional multispectral imagery.
